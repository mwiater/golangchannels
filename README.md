# Golang-Channels

## Reference Article

**See my accompanying article on Level Up Coding here:** https://levelup.gitconnected.com/golang-channels-goroutines-and-optimal-concurrency-demystifying-through-examples-a43ba6aee74f

## To Do

 - [ ] Benchmark docs and examples
 - [ ] Better tests
 - [ ] More documentation via godocs after tests are updated

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:mwiater/golangchannels.git
cd golangchannels
go get
```

Optional:

* For linting with `make golang-lint`: **[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) must be installed**
* For testing with `make golang-test`: **[gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum#install) must be installed.**

## Application

### Convenience Commands

**NOTE:** _This repository was created to run on a linux x86 machine. There are example `make` commands and scripts to cross-compile to other architectures, but these convenience methods have only been tested from a linux x86 source (though the corss-compiled binaries have been successfully tested on the appropriate source architectures). If you are on another source architecture, native `go` commands should work fine, but the build scripts included here may not. See the `./scripts` directory to see what the bash scripts are doing--you should be able to infer the native `go` commands for your system, if you have issues executing any of the convenience scripts._

Type `make` for a list of commands (comments added for clarity):

```
Targets in this Makefile:

make golang-benchmark       # Run benchmark test: ./dispatcher/dispatcher_test.go
make golang-build-arm64     # Build the application binary to: ./bin/golangchannels-arm64
make golang-build-linux64   # Build the application binary to: ./bin/golangchannels
make golang-build-windows64 # Build the application binary to: ./bin/bin/golangchannels.exe
make golang-godoc           # Start the documentation server
make golang-lint            # Lint the application
make golang-pprof           # Generate pprof profiles in ./pprof
make golang-run             # Compile and run the binary
make golang-test            # Run the tests

For details on these commands, see the bash scripts in the 'scripts/' directory.
```

## Run the application

Type: `make golang-run`

## `.env`: Override default settings

You can use the `.env` file to override the default values. Blank values will become the defaults below (comments added for clarity):

```
DEBUG=true              // Verbose console output, default: false
JOBNAME=                // Job: EmptySleepJob (default), PiJob, or IoJob
STARTINGWORKERCOUNT=    // Workers to start the test with, default: 1
MAXWORKERCOUNT=         // Workers to ramp up to, default: runtime.NumCPU()
TOTALJOBCOUNT=          // Jobs to run, default: runtime.NumCPU() * 2
```

With the default values above, on an 8 CPU core system, the application:

* Runs a total of 8 passes:
  * The first pass with STARTINGWORKERCOUNT workers,  in this example: **1**
  * Add one worker for the next pass
  * Repeat until MAXWORKERCOUNT is reached, in this example: **8**
  * Total jobs to process: **16**
* Display a list of Summary Results: 

Type: `make golang-run`

**Example 01: `EmptySleepJob` Results:**

With the `.env` file shown above, the results are:

```

Expectations:
* ✅ As each job is just a `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)` command, each job should take about **1 second to execute.**
* ✅ As expected, **1 worker completing 16 of these jobs takes about 16 seconds** and **8 workers runs approximately 8 times as fast: 2 seconds.**


**Example 02: `PiJob` Results:**

To run a similar test, but with a different job, just change the `JOBNAME` (options: `EmptySleepJob`, `PiJob`, or `IoJob`)

```
DEBUG=true
JOBNAME=PiJob
STARTINGWORKERCOUNT=
MAXWORKERCOUNT=
TOTALJOBCOUNT=
```

The `PiJob` represents a CPU-bound test, so the overall concurrency performance will be much lower than the `EmptySleepJob`:

### make golang-benchmark

`make golang-benchmark` To benchmark the application via: `./dispatcher/dispatcher_test.go`

### make golang-build

`make golang-build` Build the application binary to: `./bin/golangchannels`

make golang_build_arm64
make golang_build_linux64
make golang_build_windows64

### make golang-godoc

`make golang-godoc` To start the docs server: `Starting godoc server on port: 6060...` The root directory for this app is: `/pkg/github.com/mattwiater/golangchannels/`

### make golang-lint

`make golang-lint` **[golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/) must be installed** to lint the application.

### make golang-pprof

`make golang-pprof` **[pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof#building-pprof) must be installed** to generate `cpuprofile`, `memprofile`, `blockprofile`, and, `mutexprofile` profiles. This command will generate 1-8 profiles of each type, which can then be analyzed via the command line (e.g.: `go tool pprof ./pprof/cpuprofile-08-workers.out`) or visually via a browser (e.g.: `go tool pprof -http='{your-ip-address}:8081' ./pprof/cpuprofile-08-workers.out`).

Example Output (Just showing the first of 8 benchmarks):

### make golang-run

`make golang-run` To run the application. **NOTE: This command compiles and executes the binary in: `./bin/golangchannels` If you just want to run the application, use: `go run .`**

### make golang-test

`make golang-test` **[gotestsum](https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum#install) must be installed** to test the application.

## Code coverage:

`go test ./... -coverprofile ./coverage/coverprofile.out`

`go tool cover -html=./coverage/coverprofile.out -o ./coverage/cover.html`

The commands above will generate a test coverage report: `./coverage/cover.html`
